Reflection attacks against symmetric key-based authentication involve intercepting authentication requests and sending them back to the user, tricking them into authenticating themselves and capturing their responses.
Countermeasures against reflection attacks include implementing challenge-response mechanisms, using timestamps or nonces, employing cryptographic authentication protocols, and ensuring secure transmission channels.
A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties, posing as the legitimate sender to the recipient and vice versa.
Countermeasures against MITM attacks involve implementing end-to-end encryption, using digital signatures for message integrity, employing certificate-based authentication, and establishing secure communication channels using protocols like SSL/TLS.
